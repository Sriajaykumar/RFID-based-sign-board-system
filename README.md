## OBJECTIVE:
   The objective of this project is to identify the speed breaks in highways for drivers by using the RFID technology. In this project the each vehicles should have one RFID reader. This project improves the security performance because without help they can identify the speed break. RFID reader is the circuit which generates 125KHZ magnetic signal. This magnetic signal is transmitted by the loop antenna connected along with this circuit which is used to read the RFID card number.So each vehicle like car,bus,lorry has the individual RFID reader. Reader is interfaced with microcontroller. Here the microcontroller is the flash type reprogrammable microcontroller in which we already programmed with card number. When the RFID reader sense the RFID tag immediately the controller will switch on the voice for indication. So the user can easily identify speed break which is nearing. The voice processor is stored some inbuilt voice, class room names.
